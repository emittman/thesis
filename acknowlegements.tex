\section*{Acknowlegements}

I would like to thank the Department of Statistics for the care it demonstrates in educating new statisticians and its high standards in research. I believe it has prepared me well. This would not have been possible without the hard work and excellence of the faculty and staff. Thank you, thesis committee, for your devotion to your students, and for committing time to my dissertation and taking part in my oral defense.

I would particularly like to thank Jarad Niemi, my advisor, for his enthusiasm for research, his open-mindedness and his critical eye. I also thank Dr. Meeker for offering encouragement and guidance regarding a class project that developed into a major thesis component. I have learned a lot from him, both technical and practical.

Many thanks to my parents, both natural and in-law for providing a backstop, making it feasible to change course in my 30's and pursue a degree. I have been truly blessed.

Lastly, thank you Jessa for your loving devotion and for managing many details, large and small, while my mind was elsewhere. I don't know what I'd do without you.
