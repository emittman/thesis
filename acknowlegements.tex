\section*{Acknowlegements}
I wish to thank the Iowa State University Statistics Department: First, for their courtesy, which helped encourage me to leave my previous job to take this plunge. Second, for its integrity, intelligence and earnestness, which motivated and sustained my peers and I to not be satisfied with superficial levels of understanding and to stick with it. Third, for the kindness and care displayed uniformly by all members of the faculty and staff, which enriches the culture and keeps us from going off the deep end.

Special thanks go to Jarad Niemi, for teaching me how to research, keeping my eye on the ball and telling it straight. Special thanks also to Bill Meeker, Dan Nettleton and Philip Dixon for your excellent teaching and for making statistics fun.

Many thanks to my parents, Tom and Laurie, and my in-laws, Jim and Roz, for providing all manner of support and encouragement.

Lastly, and most importantly, thanks to my wife, Jessa, for her hard work, cooking dinner, and for worrying about the details, which would never get done without her. You deserve a break.
